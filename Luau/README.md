_FILL: brief language summary_

* Language resources:
  - _FILL: links to a few websites, repositories, papers, videos, etc._
* If-T version: _FILL: version number_
* Implementation: _FILL: path to main file_


#### Type System Basics

> Q. What is the top type in this language? What is the bottom type? What is the dynamic type?
> If these types do not exist, explain the alternatives.

_FILL in here_


> Q. What base types does this implementation use? Why?


> Q. What container types does this implementation use (for objects, tuples, etc)? Why?



#### Type Narrowing

> Q. How do simple type tests work in this language?


> Q. Are there other forms of type test? If so, explain.


> Q. How do type casts work in this language?


> Q. What is the syntax for a symmetric (2-way) type-narrowing predicate?


> Q. If the language supports other type-narrowing predicates, describe them below.


#### Benchmark Details

> Q. Are any benchmarks inexpressible? Why?

_FILL in here_


> Q. Are any benchmarks expressed particularly well, or particularly poorly? Explain.


> Q. How direct (or complex) is the implementation compared to the pseudocode from If-T?
